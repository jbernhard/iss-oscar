# iSS-OSCAR

This is a slighty modified version of the iSS hypersurface sampler, written by Zhi Qiu and Chun Shen at Ohio State University.  It reads 2+1D hydro
freeze-out hypersurfaces in standard OSCAR format and outputs particles in 3+1D.


## Compilation

iSS-OSCAR is built via the standard CMake process:

  1. `mkdir build && cd build`
  2.  `cmake ..`
  3.  `make`
  4.  `make install`

This will placed the compiled `iSS` binary in project root.
